<p><strong>Ethisphere World’s Most Ethical Companies:</strong> In 2023, Voya Financial was one of 135 companies recognized by Ethisphere® as one of the 2023 World’s Most Ethical Companies®, based on performance in 2022. The World’s Most Ethical Company assessment is based upon Ethisphere’s Ethics Quotient® framework, which offers a quantitative way to assess a company’s performance in an objective, consistent and standardized way. The information collected provides a comprehensive sampling of definitive criteria of core competencies, rather than all aspects of corporate governance, risk, sustainability, compliance and ethics. Scores are generated in five key categories: ethics and compliance program (35%), culture of ethics (20%), environmental and social impact (20%), governance (15%) and leadership and reputation (10%) and provided to all companies who participate in the process. While Voya’s Senior Vice President of Corporate and Organizational Development sits on Ethisphere’s Equity and Social Justice Initiative Advisory Council, he plays no role in the selection process for the World’s Most Ethical Company award, but this fact has been disclosed to the extent it may be perceived as a possible conflict of interest. There is a processing fee of $3,500 USD to participate. There is also a $35,000 USD licensing fee for use of the logo. “World’s Most Ethical Companies” and “Ethisphere” names and marks are registered trademarks of Ethisphere LLC.</p>

<p><strong>Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America:</strong> Voya Financial was selected for inclusion in the 2022 Dow Jones Sustainability (DJSI) Index by the S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. Winners are selected on an annual basis. Voya did not pay to be considered for the recognition. Launched in 1999, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) is the first global index to track the leading sustainability-driven companies based on an analysis of financially material environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors and S&amp;P DJSI’s robust index methodology, which includes the annual S&amp;P Global Sustainability Assessment (CSA) to evaluate more than 11,000 companies around the world.</p>

<p><strong>Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index:</strong> In 2023, Voya was accepted into the 2023 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index for the 8th consecutive year. Voya is one of 484 companies accepted to the 2023 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index, which represents organizations from 54 industries with headquarters in 45 countries and regions. To qualify for the index, Voya disclosed details of its policies and practices with respect to how the company promotes gender equality across four separate areas – company statistics, policies, community engagement and products and services. Voya and other companies included in the 2023 Gender-Equality Index scored above a globally-established threshold, based on the extent of disclosures and the achievement of best-in-class statistics and policies.</p>

<p><strong>Human Rights Campaign Best Places to Work:</strong> In 2022, Voya Financial earned a “100 percent” ranking and the designation as a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality on the 2022 Human Rights Council Corporate Equality Index, administered by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. The Corporate Equality Index (CEI), administered by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, evaluates LGBTQ-related policies and practices, including non-discrimination workplace protections, domestic partner benefits, transgender-inclusive health care benefits, competency programs, and public engagement with the LGBTQ community. Voya’s efforts in satisfying all of the CEI’s criteria earns it a “100 percent” ranking and the designation as a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality.</p>

<p><strong>Great Place to Work: </strong>In 2023, Voya Financial was certified as a Great Place To Work for October 2023 – October 2024. Voya Financial paid a fee to the Great Place To Work Institute to conduct certification surveys, upon which the award was based. Voya Financial earned this recertification based on ratings provided by more than 1,600 of its employees in a survey administered by the Great Place To Work® Institute.</p>

<p><strong>Disability Equality Index: </strong>In 2023, Voya Financial was recognized by Disability:IN and the American Association of People with Disabilities as a 2023 Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion, earning a spot on the Disability Equality Index® (DEI). The recognition is based on 2022 information and a $600 administrative fee was paid for consideration. The 2023 DEI measured culture and leadership; enterprise-wide accessibility; employment practices (benefits, recruitment, employment, education, retention and advancement, and accommodations); community engagement; and supplier diversity. Voya Financial was one of 405 participating companies scoring 80% or higher. While Voya’s Senior Vice President, chief communications and brand officer is the Vice Chair of the Disability:IN board of directors, he plays no role in the selection process for the Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion award, but this fact has been disclosed to the extent it may be perceived as a possible conflict of interest.</p>
